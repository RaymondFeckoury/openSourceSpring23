<b>To run the react application after cloning your fork of the repo and opening in VS Code:</b>

1. Execute: <b>cd my-app</b>
- This is the directory that was created after creating the react application with the “npx create-react-app my-app” command.
You must be inside this directory to run the application

2. Execute: <b>npm install</b>
- This installs all of the packages and dependencies in the node_modules folder. This will take a few seconds
Execute: npm start

3. Execute: <b>npm start dev</b>
- This runs the application in development mode, so you don't have to re-run application to see changes everytime
